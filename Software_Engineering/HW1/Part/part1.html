<p>Doctors and lawyer are certified to do there job because it has a direct impact on the quality of life of people. If there was no standards to adhere to then people would be wrongfully convicted and bad people will not be punished. Sick people may or may not get quality care and the overall quality of life would be very bad. This is exactly the same reason engineers should be certified there jop directly affect the quality of life of people, imagine if the empire state building collapsed the casualties would severe. We run the risk of this kind of scenario occurring on a frequent basis, if just any one was allowed to calculate the math for structural integrity of building like the empire state building. Computers play a major role in our society today, traffic systems are one example of this. if they keep glitching all because some random person wrote the software or designed the electrica componentes involved then the rates of accidents i likely to be double maybe even triple times what its now. This are the ways engineers affect our lives and thus it is paramount that they are held to a standard that certify them and ensure that likelihood of an important system failing very low on average.
    Examples of real life mishaps when that can occur frequently when engineers are not certified like lawyers and doctors.
