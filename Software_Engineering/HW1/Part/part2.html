<p>The challenges  that software engineering is likely to face in the 21st century aside from heterogeneity, business and social change and trust and security is evolution. Everything change but sometimes change brings new set of problems that are the responsibility of our past action. Change also bring about new requirement that may be costly to us in one form or the other. Software engineering is not different as it evolves it is will require changes to existing systems that may be costly in terms of our environment and integration. 

        First we will consider challenges in terms of  environment. The general trend in software development is in large scale cloud computing. Such activity require large amount of computational power that is gotten from computer servers housed in some facility.
        Such facility example a database facility could house 20 of such systems this systems need to be powered and would consume energy. Regardless of the source of energy there would be some amount of carbon footprint.Just like gass software expends, with new hardware comes more demanding software that would require make the energy requirement of the hardware increase. So part of the challenges would how design software that use less hardware reuse but is still advance enough to be considered evolution.
        
        Then we think about integration which is still tired to the environment. As stated before new hardware run more advanced software which leads to evolution. The problem now is what do we do with the previous system. When do we integrate with it or when do we discard it. This is a major issue as we know computers are made of silicon and as such are not biodegradable. Thus we have a serious problem of waste disposal as we throw out old system and build new one. The challenge is how do we recycle or integrate with this old system efficiently so we throw less silicon away reduce environmental contamination
