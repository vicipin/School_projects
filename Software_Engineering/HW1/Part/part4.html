<p>Most software require that we trust it some sort of sensitive information or sensitive task. If legal, social,ethical and professional care are not taken then there can be a lot of issues.
                One such issue would ease of access to someone's personal information such as there social security number. Another example would software specifically made to harm people.granted this already happens today but without regulation it will be even more rampant.thus it is important provide a set of ethical guidelines to guide the development of software.
