<h1>Prototype</h1>
<p>

Software prototyping is creating a prototype or scratchpad of the software specification in question to have a more indepth idea of the developing software in question would like. Software prototypes are not versatile and do not take into account future changes, thus one you create a software prototype that is it any further changes to design or specification would require a new prototype. Given this software prototyping is very expensive.

</p>


<p><b>Pros</b></P>

<br><p>1.  With prototype you can focus on things that are not well understood in the specification.</p>
<br><p>2.  Gives a clearer picture of what is required.</p>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<br><p>1.  It is impossible to tune the system for correction or required spec.</p>
<br><p>2.  It  is usually undocumented.</p>
<br><p>3.  It is rushed and as such the structure is lose and overall quality is low.</p>
<br><p>4.  Prototypes are usually throw away and become useless after a new prototype is made or the original software is being developed</p>

<p><b>Incremental Delivery</b></P>

<p>
Unlike prototype the software development cycle of incremental delivery is more future oriented. Measures are put in place to deliver additional functionality as the software is being develop. Basically the first software you start with is what you build on over time until you have reached the required specs or the process could go on forever. The process relies heavily on customer support and would prioritize what the customer wants.
</p>

<p><b>Pros</P></b>

<br><p>1.  There is room for changes and it can easily fit what the customer wants.</p>
<br><p>2.  The overall process is cheaper.</p>
<br><p>3.  Errors are easily tracked and fixed improving the overall quality over time and giving a more realistic use of the software.</p>
<br><p>4.  More team oriented and can implement agile process easily.</p>
<br><p>5.  Low risk for project abandonment.</p>
<br><p>6.  There is extensive testing for more important system.</p>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<br><p>1.  Because the release are development process are interleaved, it is easy to lose track of things without proper management tools.</p>
<br><p>2.  One may not have a clear vision of what the software specification should be.</p>
<br><p>3.  Development process can be strict with delivery time.</p>
<br><p>4.  In early stages the developed software might not integrate with older system.</p>
<br><p>5.  Early stages might not have all required modules.</p>
