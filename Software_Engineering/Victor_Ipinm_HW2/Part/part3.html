<p>
There is a huge risk of miscommunication. If there is problem that occur it may be difficult to relay the exact nature of the problem. Aside from this people relay a message differently and if there is something the whole team needs to know there could be several version of that message causing serious confusion. This will hamper productivity and delay sprint cycles. To solve this problem it is import that the team have a meeting like they would in the physical except now the meeting would take place in virtual space. Also it will be useful to invest in remote desktop for implementations like pair programing. This way it would make it seem like they were always at the office.
