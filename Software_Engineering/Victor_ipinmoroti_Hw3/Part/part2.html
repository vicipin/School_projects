<p>One of the method of agile is iterative approach to software development by this the development of said software is a cycle and would move from specification to implementation to testing and back to specification. This is pretty much the incremental model as each iteration makes the software different from its previous version by being either better at acquired functionalities or by just have newer functionalities. This best suited for an environment where the need keep changing. But in a batch like environment where there is a set routine and real time event really depend on that routine you want to get it all right from the get go thus you need a plan driven development.
