<p>
The architecture is a platform for which the entire system would be built on , thus it stands to reason that it may have to be designed before specification as it can serve as a guide for basic requirements.<br> 
It could also serve as model for the customers as it can give a much better picture of the developers are designing.<br> 
Giving this the customers can then give criticism and the architecture can be redesigned to reflect needed requirements specification.
