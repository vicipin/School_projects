      <p>Availability require a level of fault tolerance generally seen in duplicate parallel systems that are decentralized.<br> 
	  Thus we need to replicate multiple aspect of the design so we have redundancy. <br>
	  That way when one part of the system fail the other part will be available with identical data and metadata. <br>
	  While this is great for availability it is detrimental to security as securing all replicated data would require even more resources increasing the chance for leakage.<br> 
	  Thus it is paramount that design has enough compromise between how many data is redundant and well can all those data be protected.</P>
