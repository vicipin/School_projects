        <p>Note this goes from bottom to top in the layer stack figure</p>
			<p><br>1. First we we need to store the information about this flight somewhere to do this we will need a database hence first level database.</p>
			<p><br>2. Next we need to retrieve these information from the database, so the next layer would be how we do this. </p>
			<p><br>	  This could be the (DBMS) database management system, search algorithm and sql software such as the server management studio.</p>
			<p><br>3. Then we need to interact with these information when we get. We might process other data with it or we might use it to fill a form.</p>
			<p><br>	  The system responsible for this is the third layer.</p>
			<p><br>4. Finally we need Graphical User Interface, a front end if you will that we interact with so we can retrieve the information.</p>
